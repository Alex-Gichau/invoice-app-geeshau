A React project that involves connecting to Google Sheets typically uses the Google Sheets API to interact with spreadsheet data. This can involve tasks like reading, writing, updating, and deleting data in a Google Sheets spreadsheet directly from a React application. You'll likely need to authenticate the user with OAuth 2.0 and handle authorization to access their Google Sheets. Then, you can use libraries like `googleapis` or `axios` to make API requests to interact with the spreadsheet.
